# GARNET + BEDROCK = Powerful Chatbot

This project shows how to consume data stored in the Garnet Framework using bedrock and agents for bedrock.  

One of the prerequisites for this project is that you have Garnet already installed populated with data.  
This tutorial is based on the `BikeHireDockingStation` Smart Data Model:  
https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/tree/4df15072b13da6c7bd7e86915df91fb28921aa7f/BikeHireDockingStation

You can of course easily update this example to suit other Data Model

You first need to setup Amazon bedrock and Agents for Amazon Bedrock. For this follow the those [Steps](bedrock/README.md)  
Then you can follow the second [part](webapp/README.md)
